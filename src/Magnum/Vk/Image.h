@brief Image

@section Vk-Image-creation Image creation

Pass one of the @ref ImageCreateInfo subclasses depending on desired image type
with desired usage, format, size and other propoerties to the @ref Image
constructor together with specifying @ref MemoryFlags for memory allocation.

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Image-creation

@attention At this point, a dedicated allocation is used, subsequently
    accessible through @ref dedicatedMemory(). This behavior may change in the
    future.

With an @ref Image ready, you may want to proceed to @ref ImageView creation.

@subsection Vk-Image-creation-custom-allocation Custom memory allocation

Using @ref Image(Device&, const ImageCreateInfo&, NoAllocateT), the image will
be created without any memory attached. Image memory requirements can be
subsequently queried using @ref memoryRequirements() and an allocated memory
bound with @ref bindMemory(). See @ref Memory for further details about memory allocation.

@snippet MagnumVk.cpp Image-creation-custom-allocation

Using @ref bindDedicatedMemory() instead of @ref bindMemory() will transfer
ownership of the @ref Memory to the image instance, making it subsequently
available through @ref dedicatedMemory(). This matches current behavior of the
@ref Image(Device&, const ImageCreateInfo&, MemoryFlags) constructor shown
above, except that you have more control over choosing and allocating the
memory.

           one layer it suddenly becomes just 2D, breaking everything). */
